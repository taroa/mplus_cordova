# mplus_cordova

first install cordova, then add platforms under mplus_cordova directory:   

$ corodva platform add browser   
$ corodva platform add android   
$ corodva platform add ios   

to build and running:   

$ cordova run android   
...and so on...   


basically nothing in this repository modified the original responsive design, just applied it into an iframe and try to mimic a slideout menu, feel free to delete it if you think it's baffling or foundamentally wrong!  LoL
